  <h3 class="page-title">Biscoe's Contribution</h3>
  <p>Tyndale Biscoe School's contribution to the sport of swimming in the valley of Kashmir has been massive. This great missionary school has always put emphasis on swimming. From the early twentieth century, Biscoe had a law that every student must pass the swimming test by the age of thirteen and those who didn't were penalized by an increase in fees every year until they passed the swimming test. Over time, swimming across Srinagar's famous Dal and Wular Lakes became an annual event. The vision of the incharges of the school to make their students good swimmers was due to the fact that Kashmir is a land of rivers, canals, lakes and they naturally thought that Kashmiris must be good swimmers. Fortunately making that possible was made much easier because the schools were located on the rivers or canals. Due to the staff and students of the school being good swimmers the schoolâ€™s staff and boys have saved hundreds of lives from drowning. The last life-saving was performed by our greatly honoured Headmaster Shanker Koul who at the age of 68 plunged into the river, and in dark at 2 AM on a cold morning in November brought to shore a man heavier than himself whilst the brother of the drowning man aged 32 and a B.A of Punjab University held out a torch to guide him. This B.A unfortunately was not a swimmer; he had not been educated at the C.M.S School</p>
<br>
<p>The school has further promoted the sport of swimming by organizing the Dal Cross swims and events like Water Polo, Swimming Gala which are held annually. Some of the pictures of the events organized by Tyndale Biscoe School are added below.</p>
